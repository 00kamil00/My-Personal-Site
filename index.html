        <p><b>Hi, my name is Kamil!</b><br>
          I'm currently learning programming - focusing on Python, HTML, CSS, and soon JavaScript. <br>
          I'm passionate about technology and the endless possibilities of creating apps and websites. <br>
          Besides programming, I'm also exploring trading, and in my free time, I enjoy staying active - whether it's hitting the gym or snowboarding. <br>
          My goal is to grow into a software developer or an entrepreneur in the tech industry. <br>
          What drives me the most is the freedom of choice that comes with personal growth and building something of my own.</p>

      <h2>My Projects</h2>
      
      <p><b>MemeBot (Python + Discord API)</b><br>
        A simple Discord bot that responds to user commands. <br>
        It can, for example, send greetings or random memes. <br>
        This was my first project using an API, which helped me understand the basics of interaction between applications.</p>

      <p><b>Area Calculator (Python)</b><br>
        A console application for calculating the area of basic geometric shapes: triangle, rectangle, square, and circle. <br>
        The program takes user input (e.g., length, width) and returns the result. <br>
        This project helped me practice handling input and implementing simple mathematical algorithms in Python.</p>

      <p><b>Pomodoro App (HTML/CSS/JS)</b><br>
        Pomodoro App is a simple and intuitive tool designed to support the Pomodoro technique for better time management. <br>
        The screen displays a 25-minute timer inside a circle, and when the Start button is pressed, the countdown begins. <br>
        Once the time runs out, a sound notification signals the end of the work session. <br>
        The app was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and is part of my personal portfolio.
